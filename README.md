Tinder Full Stack Coding Challenge
===================================

<img src="http://i.imgur.com/nh8oB6C.gif" />

Create the Tinder card stack in html/js/css. At a minimum, this must:

* Recognize swipe left and swipe right gestures
* Render properly on an iPhone 6
* Populate "cards" using data from a backend API endpoint (this can be static json)

Bonus points for:

* Using react or angularjs for your JS framework
* Using node.js, go, or python for your backend
* Making the site responsive so it works well on desktop and arbitrary screen sizes
* Including a gamepad
* Bringing up the It's a match! screen on right swipe
* Adding cool features

We will be evaluating your submission based on how closely it matches the native experience, as well as the structure of the code.

Please submit your solution as a pull request to this repository, and include in it a link to your working example.
