At a minimum, this must:

* Recognize swipe left and swipe right gestures
* Render properly on an iPhone 6
* Populate "cards" using data from a backend API endpoint (this can be static json)

Bonus points for:

* Using react or angularjs for your JS framework
* Using node.js, go, or python for your backend
* Making the site responsive so it works well on desktop and arbitrary screen sizes
* Including a gamepad
* Bringing up the It's a match! screen on right swipe
* Adding cool features

We will be evaluating your submission on both the efficiency and readability of your code and the degree to which your product matches the native experience.

Please submit your solution as a pull request to this repository or email a zip directly to your recruiter, and include in it:

* a link to your working example
* how long this took you
* what you would add/change if you had more time
